# Tribes1-Menu

These are updated menu functions for Starsiege: TRIBES (Tribes 1).

Various purposes (paging/scrolling options, menu option forcing, etc.), and branches will be defined based on the Tribes versions they are applied to (1.11, 1.4x, etc.).

If you need any other help with what this is for or how to use it, just contact me in the Discussions here, or via any number of methods through the {LS} team stuff (forums, Discord, etc.).
