# Tribes Menu Functions

These are updated menu functions for Starsiege: TRIBES (Tribes 1).

Various purposes (paging/scrolling options, menu option forcing, etc.). Different code is provided based on the applicable versions of Tribes (1.11, 1.4x, etc.).

If you need any other help with what this is for or how to use it, just contact [Shayk-N'-Bake](https://github.com/shaykbake) in the Discussions here, or via any number of methods through the {LS} team stuff (forums, Discord, etc.).
